## Analysis on flight delay

In this assignment, I studied flight delays in the Data Expo 2009 dataset from the Harvard Dataverse. I used a subset from the years 2003, 2004 and 2005. 

I used Data Cleaning, Data Manipulation, Data Visualisation and Machine Learning Techniques in both R and Python to find answers to :

1- When is the best time of the day, day of week and time of year to fly to minimise delays?

2- Do older planes suffer more delays?

3- How does the number of flights change between locations over time?

4- Can you detect cascading failures as delays in one airport cause delays in others?

5- Use the available variables to construct a model that predicts delays.
